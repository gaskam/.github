<h1 align="center">Gaskam</h1>

**Gaskam** is an open source organization led by two passionate French developers, Kamil Leys and Gaspard Lebaube. Initially established as a portfolio of our technical skills while still students, we are dedicated to sharing our innovative projects and contributing to the open source community.

## Our values

We believe in the power of open source and the importance of sharing knowledge. We are committed to creating high-quality projects that are accessible to everyone. Gaskam are always looking for new ways to improve our work and learn from others.

## Languages

Here is a list of our main (and *favorite*) languages:

We love well-optimized languages like our beloved Zig, a perfect language for anyone who's tired of being obstructed during their code session.

Rust now seems an obvious choice, both for its simplicity and its maturity as a low-level language (although Zig is much better, especially for its simplicity with Strings).

We chose Bun for security reasons, as there's a lot of room for murder when tackling a language that's so bad to begin with. That's why we needed Bun, developed in Zig, to keep us happy.

        <br><strong><a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun / TypeScript</a></strong>
      </td>
    </tr>

We've also developed in C++, Lua, HTML5, CSS, and just about anything else. As long as it's not Cobol or pure asm, we can manage to develop the best ideas that come to us.
